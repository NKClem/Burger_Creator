# Eat. Dat. Burger!
Dynamic burger-logger.  Back-end is powered by MySQL, Node, and Express, and the front-end is created using Handlebars.

## Description

This burger logger helps you keep track of the burgers you have eaten -- and remove the ones that you want to forget!  Click  on the "Devour" button of a burger located in the menu and watch it shift to the "Burgers Eaten" list; if it was supremely forgettable, click on the "Delete" button to remove it from your memory.  If you think of a burger that needs to be added to the menu, go ahead and add it!
